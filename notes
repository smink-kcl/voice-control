looking at options, rhasspy looks like a good choice

- link: https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

- hw:
--- rasp 2/3 (4?)
--- x86/amd64 laptop (WSL or Debian/Ubuntu Linux)

- instructions (prep):
--- open up a window terminal running a bash instance
--- make sure you are up to date: sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade
(note: if you don't have aptitude installed, either install it or use apt-get instead of aptitude)
--- install the following packages: python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-venv git build-essential
                          libatlas-base-dev swig portaudio19-dev supervisor mosquitto sox alsa-utils libgfortran4
                          libopenblas-dev espeak flite perl curl patchelf ca-certificates jq
(note: 'XXX is already installed at the requested version' is ok for a message)
(note: if you can't install libgfortran4 directly, then we can get it later)

- instructions: building from source - don't

- download the following debs from indicated location and install them in the order shown (sudo dpkg -i DEBNAME)
--- rhasspy - loc
--- libopenblas-base_0.3.5+ds-3_amd64.deb : https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/libopenblas-base/download
--- libgfortran4_7.4.0-6_amd64.deb : https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/libgfortran4-dbg/download
--- rhasspy_amd64.deb : https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#debian
--- libssl1.1_1.1.1w-0+deb11u1_amd64.deb : 

- sanity
- from your WSL home directory, run this: $ rhasspy -p .  # note: NO SUDO / SU
- verify it starts up and go to http://127.0.0.1:12101 in your browser (if you get a web page, it is installed but not yet configured)
- hit Ctrl-C where you started it















### end of writeup - below here are things that didn't work






- installation on win10 w/WSL and pulseAudio
--- this was tested on Windows 10 with WSL 2 with Debian 12.5 (Bookworm) and had XMing X-server installed

- instructions (build):
- $ cd $somewhere (where you want the code to live)
- $ mkdir rhasspy  # to be able to support multiple versions
- $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rhasspy/rhassp
(note: easier to do in windows and move over if you don't have git configured within WSL)
- bootstrap: $ autoreconf -fvi
- ./configure --enable-in-place
(note: if you get an error, convert the script to unix line ends: dos2unix config.sub && dos2unix config.guess)
(note: if you get more errors - this:
./configure: line 5365: syntax error near unexpected token `3.0.0,'
./configure: line 5365: `        AX_PKG_SWIG(3.0.0, ,'
                                    -> edit the configure file and remove the macro (after verifying swig is installed)

- continue building: make --no-print-directory --quiet
- install it: sudo make --no-print-directory --quiet install
(note: if you get errors: $ dos2unix scripts/*.sh scripts/install/*.sh)
(note: when you get 'error: Multiple top-level packages discovered in a flat-layout: ['m4', 'etc', 'docker', 'debian', 'rhasspy', 'download']',
   edit setup.py and add 'py_modules=["rhasspy"]' to setuptools.setup # at the end
